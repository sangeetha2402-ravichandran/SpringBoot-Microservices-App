## üîπ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **microservices architecture** using Spring Boot with the following components:

1. **University Student Microservice**  
   - Manages student information: name, age, email, enrollment details.  
   - Exposes REST endpoints for CRUD operations.

2. **Address Microservice**  
   - Handles student addresses (city, state, country, postal code).  
   - Integrates with **Student Microservice** via **OpenFeign** and **WebClient**.

3. **Database**  
   - Each microservice uses **PostgreSQL** for persistent storage.

## Eureka Server

![Repository Image](EurekaServer.png)

Eureka Server is a REST-based service registry used in microservices architectures to enable service discovery. It acts as a naming server where client services register themselves and query for other services to discover their network locations dynamically.

### Key Features

- **Service Registration:** Client microservices register with the Eureka Server upon startup.
- **Service Discovery:** Clients query the Eureka Server to find instances of other services.
- **Health Checks:** Eureka monitors registered services and removes unavailable instances for fault tolerance.
- **Load Balancing Integration:** Works seamlessly with Netflix Ribbon, Spring Cloud LoadBalancer, etc.
- **Highly Available:** Can be run in a cluster of servers for redundancy.

### How it Works

1. **Service Registration:** Services send heartbeats to Eureka to maintain their presence.
2. **Discovery Client:** When calling a dependent service, clients query Eureka to get the currently available instances.
3. **Fault Tolerance:** Eureka removes instances that fail to send heartbeats and updates the clients accordingly.

### Typical Use Case

- In a microservices setup, each service registers with Eureka Server.
- Load balancers and API gateways rely on Eureka to route requests to live services dynamically instead of hardcoding URLs.
